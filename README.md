<h2>Discussion Forum Project</h2>
This is my first full-stack project, a fully functional discussion forum that integrates both frontend and backend technologies. The forum facilitates user interactions through threads, where users can post queries or respond to existing discussions related to various programming languages.<br>

<b>User Authentication</b>: Users can sign up to create an account, and log in to post threads or respond to others.<br>
<b>Thread Management</b>: Users can view a list of programming languages and related threads, ask questions, or contribute answers.<br>
<b>Frontend</b>: Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a responsive and user-friendly interface.<br>
<b>Backend</b>: Powered by PHP and MySQL to handle data management and user interactions.<br>
<h3>How to Use:</h3><br>
