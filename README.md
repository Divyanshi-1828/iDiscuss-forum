<h3>Discussion Forum Project</h3>
This is my first full-stack project, a fully functional discussion forum that integrates both frontend and backend technologies. The forum facilitates user interactions through threads, where users can post queries or respond to existing discussions related to various programming languages.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Users can sign up to create an account, and log in to post threads or respond to others.
Thread Management: Users can view a list of programming languages and related threads, ask questions, or contribute answers.
Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Backend: Powered by PHP and MySQL to handle data management and user interactions.
How to Use:
Sign Up: Create an account to participate in discussions.
Login: Use your credentials to log in to the forum.
Post and Respond: Once logged in, you can view threads, post your queries, and respond to other users.
This forum is designed to help users clear their doubts and share knowledge about various programming languages.
